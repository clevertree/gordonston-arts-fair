History of Gordonston

# <a name='gordonston-history'>A Hidden Gem</a>

![](/img/Gates-of-Gordonston-B-W.jpg)

1917

It all started here

## Founded

Savannah’s Gordonston neighborhood was founded in 1917 in honor of William Washington Gordon III, brother of Girl Scouts
founder, Juliette Gordon Low. This 80-acre tract of land is said to be the highest ground in Savannah. It was inherited
by W.W. Gordon III and his siblings, whose family was earlier responsible for the establishment of the Central of
Georgia Railroad. Gordonston is one of Savannah’s original streetcar suburbs as it was located on the Thunderbolt
streetcar line. It now contains 238 homes built primarily in the 1920’s - 1950’s.

1926

Spacious and Green

## Dedicated Park

The six-acre Juliette Gordon Low Park was dedicated in 1926 with an endowment from its namesake. The park is fully
enclosed by an iron fence whose original gates were designed and built by Juliette Gordon Low. A fund was established by
her to maintain the park into perpetuity for the use of Gordonston residents and especially for its children. The park
also contains a playground.

1948

A Community Structure

## New Cottage

The cottage in the park was built in 1948 by Union Camp Corporation and donated to the Girl Scouts who have been holding
meetings in it for generations. Resident-sponsored, cottage rental is available by visiting
[Gordonston.com](www.Gordonston.com).
