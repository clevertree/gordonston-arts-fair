<h2 className='m-auto text-[color:var(--gold-color)] italic'>It all started here</h2>
<h3 className='m-auto text-2xl sm:text-4xl tracking-widest uppercase'>Founded</h3>

Savannah’s Gordonston neighborhood was founded in 1917 in honor of William Washington Gordon III, brother of Girl Scouts
founder, Juliette Gordon Low. This 80-acre tract of land is said to be the highest ground in Savannah. It was inherited
by W.W. Gordon III and his siblings, whose family was earlier responsible for the establishment of the Central of
Georgia Railroad. Gordonston is one of Savannah’s original streetcar suburbs as it was located on the Thunderbolt
streetcar line. It now contains 238 homes built primarily in the 1920’s—the 1950’s.

<h3 className='m-auto text-2xl sm:text-4xl tracking-widest uppercase'>Dedicated Park</h3>

The seven-acre Juliette Gordon Low Park was dedicated in 1926 with an endowment from its namesake. The park is fully
enclosed by an iron fence whose original gates were designed and built by Juliette Gordon Low. A fund was established by
her to maintain the park into perpetuity for the use of Gordonston residents and especially for its children. The park
also contains a playground.
