Dear Applicant,

The jury results for the Gordonston Art Fair to be held on {formatDate(eventDate)} are as follows:

We are limited in the number of exhibitors we can accept.
Unfortunately, much good work had to be juried out.
Because of the quality of your work, you have been placed on a waiting list.
We will notify you if and when spaces become available.

Kind regards,

The Gordonston Art Fair Committee
