Dear Artist,

After thoughtful consideration, the Gordonston Art Fair regrets to inform you that your work was not accepted for our show this year.

Because this is a juried show, we are limited to the number of exhibitors we can accept. Unfortunately, a lot of good work had to be juried out. We appreciate the opportunity to view your work and wish you the best in the future.

Kind regards,

The Gordonston Art Fair Committee
